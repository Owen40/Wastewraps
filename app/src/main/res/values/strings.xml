    <!-- Pros of Recycling waste -->
    <string name="pro_1">1. Conservation of resources: Recycling helps conserve valuable natural resources by reducing the need for raw materials extraction.</string>
    <string name="pro_2">2. Energy savings: Recycling typically requires less energy compared to producing new products from raw materials.</string>
    <string name="pro_3">3. Waste reduction: Recycling helps divert waste from landfills, reducing the strain on limited landfill space.</string>
    <string name="pro_4">4. Reduced greenhouse gas emissions: Recycling reduces the amount of energy needed for manufacturing, resulting in lower carbon emissions.</string>
    <string name="pro_5">5. Job creation: Recycling industries create employment opportunities, from collection and sorting to processing and manufacturing.</string>

    <!-- Cons of waste recycling methods -->
    <string name="con_1">1. Contamination risks: Contamination of recyclables with non-recyclable materials can reduce the quality and value of recycled products.</string>
    <string name="con_2">2. Costly infrastructure: Establishing and maintaining recycling infrastructure, such as sorting facilities and processing plants, can be expensive.</string>
    <string name="con_3">3. Limited material acceptance: Not all types of waste can be effectively recycled, limiting the scope of recycling programs.</string>
    <string name="con_4">4. Transportation emissions: The transportation of recyclables to processing facilities can contribute to carbon emissions and environmental impact.</string>
    <string name="con_5">5. Energy-intensive processes: Certain recycling methods require significant energy inputs, offsetting some of the environmental benefits.</string>
